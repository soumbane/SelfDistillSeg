# Self-Distillation of U-shaped Networks for 3D Cardiac Image Segmentation with Shape Priors

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper "SELF-DISTILLATION OF U-SHAPED NETWORKS FOR 3D CARDIAC IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH SHAPE PRIORS" that is under review for IEEE ISBI 2023.

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.9
* PyTorch >= 1.12
* [torchmanager](https://github.com/kisonho/torchmanager) >= 1.0.6
* [Monai](https://monai.io/) >= 0.9.0
* See requirements.txt (All of them are not required)

## Get Started
The following steps are required to replicate our work:
